Cricket Flour
Ingredients:
4 cups of flour 
1 cup of roasted crickets (¼ - ½ cup of crickets to every cup of flour works well.)
Directions:
Break off the antennae and legs by gently rolling the cricket between your hands. 
Once you collect enough crickets in a bowl proceed to crush either using a mortar and pestle or rolling pin on a hard surface. 
Gather the crushed crickets – they should look like small specks (usually of dark brown color) and blend them well into the flour of your choosing. 
Once you’ve blended the crickets with the flour you’re set to use it in any way you wish.
